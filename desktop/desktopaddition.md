⚠️ WHEN DOWNLOADING DESKTOP FILES THEY ARE **NOT** CONFIGURED FOR OUT-OF THE BOX USE PLEASE CONFIGURE THEM AND THEN INSTALL THEM PROPERLY OR THEY WILL NOT WORK⚠️
Hello, this is used for setting up glasspad with a desktop application, the keybinding for a window manager for hyprland **(this may not work)** with super + s it would be
bind = SUPER, S, exec, /PATH/TO/EXECUTABLE
Also the rest of the stuff in here is the actual desktop file and the logo for it incase you wanted one to display or something ( I needed one since I use it with dank material shells application shortcut widget)
So yeah thats about it for this folder there should never be anything else new inside of here besides the .desktop (or .lnk for windows idk) and the image for it.
